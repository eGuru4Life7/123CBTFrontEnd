                                    Now that you have learned to recognise your thinking errors it is time to question their validity. For the next one week, your task will be to test the reality of your thoughts. You can start by writing the evidence for and against the thought. Pretend to be a lawyer, who is presenting evidence against troubling thoughts in a court. Write down the evidence that supports the thought. But, remember, it should be evidence or facts, not your feelings or opinion. Statements, like, I believe- My heart tells me, or I am convinced cannot be used as evidence. This exercise will help you to decide how realistic your thoughts are. You can ask a friend, family member or a neighbour to help you initially to challenge your unhealthy thoughts. It can be a little tricky at the start, but with some practice, you will master the technique.</p>
