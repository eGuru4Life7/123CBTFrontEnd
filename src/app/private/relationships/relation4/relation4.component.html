                                <p>These people know how to exploit other people's weaknesses & get what they want by making others feel guilty. They play the victim card to abuse others. Manipulative people avoid taking responsibilities for their actions. They always blame others. They prey on their victimâ€™s emotional sensitivity and their conscientiousness. They are very good at detecting your weaknesses. Once they find a weakness, they use it against you. Very often they keep using you until you stop them. They are also very good at splitting others. They will say anything or do anything to get what they want. They will often say beautiful things to you and nasty things about others when they are with you. However, when they are with another person, they might praise that person and say unpleasant things about you.</p>
